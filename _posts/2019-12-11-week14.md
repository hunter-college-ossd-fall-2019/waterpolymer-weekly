If you have a job offer related to computer science, shoot me an email I’ll be more than happy to learn about it! If it’s for blog writing, I’ll take it too!

Jokes aside, it’s been a real pleasure writing for you and for this open software class. I hope you’ll fair well in what life holds in store for you, and if you happen across any of my new writings in the future…

See ya then!
