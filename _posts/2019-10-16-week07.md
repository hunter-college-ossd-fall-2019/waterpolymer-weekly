title: Week 7 - Project Evaluation 
---

Welcome back readers to my small world of grasping open source development! This week professor Weiss has permitted us all a well-deserved reprieve from extensive writing and has only tasked us with talking about the **[project evaluation assignment]( https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-fall-2019/project-evaluation-activity-01)** we did in class!

The project, for readers who only want an overview of the assignment, was to practice looking at the quality and activity of an open source project to gain insight into whether or not it would be an appropriate project for any given person to work on. The qualities in a project to for entailed:

- A welcoming community
- Responsiveness
- Activity  
- And much more.

### My experience with the project evaluation
Like all the previous activities done in class, the content of the assignment wasn’t too complicated, nor was it a walk in the park. Thinking about it more, the difficulty of all the assignments thus far have been like Goldie Locks porridge, just right!
The project that my group evaluated was an open source piece of software called Gatsby JS, a package that adds onto Node JS to help developers’ access and handle databases for website building. Although my group answered all the questions, and I myself reviewed a lot of content to find the answers, I didn’t find myself interested in working on Gatsby. As a matter of fact, my eyes began to glaze as I continued to work… I think this is due to my brain being overloaded by the sheer size of the project and all the components it has on display.

I enjoy knowing how parts of a project works, as well as what they do. My understanding doesn’t have to be too in-depth, but I having general knowledge and not leaving everything to a magic black box is my preference. Although it might be the scary cat in me, as it's scary not knowing how to solve a problem when the black box breaks down. Starting from the issues, going all the way to the pull requests, nothing in the Gatsby repository seemed familiar! Getting over this overwhelmed feeling is probably going to be my greatest hurdle taking this class. I really need to dive into the thick of a project and take a hands on approach!

Back on topic! Some problems I had with the project evaluation were related to navigating the available content on the project’s github. This includes some of the statistics provided related to the project. One of the questions was along the lines of ‘how well documented is the code,’ and the problem was navigating the tens of folders to find something that resembled a piece of code. Among the tens, if not hundreds, of config files, CSS, test cases, etc. finding where code was located was cumbersome. Statistically, some of the statistics were not easily discoverable using only Github, while the project alludes to only using Github as a resource. An example being the total lines of code written for the project, where Openhub had the statistics and Github did not.

However, I can’t solely blame the project outline. Previous schooling has taught me to work only within the confines of what is specified and to never step outside of those boundaries unless you want to be punished. This lesson has prevented me from ever wanting to test boundaries, and is definitely becoming a roadblock for me recently. I hope I’ll be able to conquer this mindset one, and this class is definitely helping me work towards that!

I think that’s all I have to say about the project evaluation, and with that there is nothing more to write about for this week! Dear reader I hope you enjoyed reading this week’s blog post, and I hope to see your beautiful visage next week!

So long!
