title: Week 1 - Hello world!
---

Welcome one and all to my first internet blog post! In today's post I'll be entailing why I am taking open software development and... that's about it.

I am currently taking open software development for a couple of reasons:
1. The credits from the class work towards my computer science degree
2. I'm interested in the subject and thought 395 was a neat opportunity to force myself into a position to learn about it
3. I want to get experience in the field but I am too lazy to get into it without some motivation (aka credits/grades on the line)

I'd love to write more, but I'm not too sure what topics are allowed to be covered in these posts aside from the assigned question(s) and content. 

I guess that'll sum up the first post of this semester? If you want to learn more about me, I wrote up a small description about myself in the *about* page to your upper right corner, or you can click on [**this ol' link here**](https://hunter-college-ossd-fall-2019.github.io/waterpolymer-weekly/about/). Neat isn't it? I learned about using markdown from our some-what mandatory **[markup tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)**. Make sure to check it out if you're interested in learning more about markdown yourself! And with that...

Goodnight world!
